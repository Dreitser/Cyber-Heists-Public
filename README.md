Please contact our team for beta access to the game. 

## Project Overview
Cyber Heists is a co-op heist game set in a sci-fi cyberpunk world. It uses non-obligatory NFTs, AI and Durable Nonces to give players and collectors a unique combination of action, adventure, mystery and collecting.

# Durable Nonces
We use Phantom Wallet with Durable Nonces that are triggered by in-game events. This allows player/collectors to come back and claim rewards, join raids, form teams and sell loot anytime, without breaking gameplay.
In this prototype we explore the advanced functionality of Durable Nonces. By leveraging the speed and convenience - we are able to build some novel use cases that work really well in gaming.

## Collectible Items
Collectible Items are implemented using traditional wallet indexing. In this project we explored the delivery of items in real-time using Durable Nonces. While not the most innovative use case, this  proof-of-concept is a great learning tool.

## Unlockable Maps
Unlockable Maps are coded simarly to Collectible Items, this implemenantaion allows for games to lock players out of areas until they connect and sign the Durable Nonce. This use-case is great for non-obligatory NFTs.

## Join A Raid
This may be the best use case for Durable Nonces. By allowing players to send "Party Invites" to other players, we leverage both the blockchain and social channels.

## Loot Share
By having blockchain rewards in the raid mission, the value propositionn and quest structure really comes together. With this Proof-of-concept we establish functiolity similar to Word or Warcraft - a very popular game mechanic.

# AI
Cyber Heists uses Inworld AI powered dialog and interaction for all NPCs (non player characters) - we expirimented with AI Powered world generation as well in the Mech level.

## Autonomous Goals and Agendas
We integrate the full neural network of Inworld AI to power the Quest and Goal Functionality.
