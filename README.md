Please contact our team for beta access to the game. 

## Project Overview
Cyber Heists is a co-op heist game set in a sci-fi cyberpunk world. It uses non-obligatory NFTs, AI and Durable Nonces to give players and collectors a unique combination of action, adventure, mystery and collecting.

## Durable Nonces
We use Phantom Wallet with Durable Nonces that are triggered by in-game events. This allows player/collectors to come back and claim rewards, join raids, form teams and sell loot anytime, without breaking gameplay.

## AI
Cyber Heists uses Inworld AI powered dialog and interaction for all NPCs (non player characters)
